    "> Since the spoofer is kind of like the Other's \"heart\" and \"eyes\" in terms of the data it produces, the idea of it existing in the gallery is kind of spooky, in a good way!  Sort of like physical proof of the coldness and inaccuracy of the data collected.  I like how the first image looks very technical.  The fact that it's generating quantitative versions of \"emotions\" makes that really funny.  \n",

Since it is a simulated person, having feeds for the \"eyes\" (the Google Earth images\", the \"heart\" (moods/sleep/BPM), and whatever may correlate to the Amazon searches (\"brain\", maybe?) could be interesting as well!
