I manually tracked my family's mood, sleep patterns, texting habits, genetics, and browsing history over seven days in order to formulate a theoretical extra sibling's entire life, and will use the information to make both a literal portrait and a data portrait. This sibling is an example of who companies (Amazon, Verily/Google, Gyroscope, Facebook) think we are–a "police sketch" of a person made entirely of stolen data–and by doing it manually, I want to prove the subjectivity of human health, mentality, interests, fears, and relationships that these groups will always be both dangerously invading our privacy for without thinking of the consequences, and will never truly be able capture.
