Personal health monitors including the FitBit and Apple Watch are capable to monitoring your heart fo irregular heartbeats. 

A huge study suggests that personal surveillance devices can detect atrial fibrillation, aka irregular heartbeats. 

More than 419,000 users signed up for the study, the largest ever to explore screening healthy people for atrial fibrillation. 

The watch warned about 2100 participants in the study that they might have a serious heart condition. This could be the start of a new trend in technological assisted self-help. 

Should Apple devices replace a Doctor's care? “I would not advise this to the overall general population,” said Dr Valentin Fuster, director of Mount Sinai Heart in New York.
